# Debugging Notes

## What is Debugging?
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors (bugs) in your code using tools and logs.

## Tools Used
- **console.log()** – to check variable values and code flow.  
- **DevTools → Sources tab** – to set breakpoints and pause code execution.  
- **Watch expressions** – to track variable changes while debugging.

## Steps Followed
1. Opened DevTools in the browser and added breakpoints in `script.js`.  
2. Used `console.log(todos)` to check if tasks were being added properly.  
3. Checked if LocalStorage was updated correctly after adding, editing, or deleting tasks.  
4. Fixed the issues and re-tested the Todo App.

## Conclusion
Debugging helped me understand the code flow, find mistakes faster, and ensure the Todo App works correctly with persistence.
